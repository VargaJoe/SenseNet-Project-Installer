# Story 09 - Plugin Architecture and Extensibility

## Overview
Create a robust plugin architecture that allows third-party developers to extend Plot Manager with custom steps, plots, and integrations without modifying core code.

## Goals
- Design flexible plugin architecture
- Create plugin development SDK and documentation
- Implement plugin marketplace or registry
- Provide plugin templates and examples

## Acceptance Criteria
- Plugin architecture with clear interfaces and contracts
- Plugin SDK with development tools and templates
- Plugin discovery and loading mechanism
- Plugin versioning and dependency management
- Plugin security and sandboxing
- Community plugin marketplace or registry

## Tasks
- Design plugin architecture and interfaces
- Create plugin base classes and contracts
- Implement plugin discovery and loading system
- Add plugin lifecycle management (install, enable, disable, remove)
- Create plugin development SDK and tools
- Implement plugin versioning and dependency resolution
- Add plugin security validation and sandboxing
- Create plugin templates for common scenarios
- Develop plugin documentation and tutorials
- Implement plugin marketplace or registry
- Add plugin testing and validation framework
- Create sample plugins for demonstration

## Business Value
- Extended functionality without core code changes
- Community-driven ecosystem development
- Faster feature development through third-party contributions
- Customization capabilities for specific enterprise needs

## Dependencies
- Story 03 (Standardized code provides clean architecture for plugins)
- Story 04 (Testing framework validates plugin quality)

## Estimated Effort
Large (2 weeks) - Significant architecture design and implementation

## Status
Planned
