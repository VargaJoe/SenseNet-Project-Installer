# Story 08 - Monitoring and Observability Platform

## Overview
Implement comprehensive monitoring, logging, and observability features to provide deep insights into Plot Manager operations and deployment health.

## Goals
- Centralized logging and log aggregation
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Infrastructure monitoring and alerting
- Distributed tracing for complex workflows

## Acceptance Criteria
- Centralized logging with ELK stack or similar
- Application performance monitoring integration
- Infrastructure monitoring with metrics and alerting
- Distributed tracing for end-to-end workflow visibility
- Custom dashboards and reporting
- Automated incident response and notifications

## Tasks
- Set up centralized logging infrastructure (ELK/EFK stack)
- Implement structured logging in PowerShell scripts
- Add application performance monitoring (APM) integration
- Create custom metrics and KPIs for automation workflows
- Implement infrastructure monitoring (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Set up alerting rules and notification channels
- Create monitoring dashboards with Grafana or similar
- Implement distributed tracing for complex deployments
- Add log correlation and analysis capabilities
- Create automated incident response workflows
