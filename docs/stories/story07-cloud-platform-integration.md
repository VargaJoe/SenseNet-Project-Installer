# Story 07 - Cloud Platform Integration

## Overview
Expand cloud platform support beyond Azure to include AWS, Google Cloud, and multi-cloud deployment scenarios with advanced cloud-native features.

## Goals
- Add AWS deployment automation support
- Implement Google Cloud Platform integration
- Support multi-cloud deployment strategies
- Integrate cloud-native services (databases, storage, monitoring)

## Acceptance Criteria
- AWS deployment automation with CloudFormation/CDK
- Google Cloud deployment with Deployment Manager/Terraform
- Multi-cloud configuration and deployment support
- Cloud-native database integration (RDS, Cloud SQL, etc.)
- Cloud storage integration (S3, Azure Blob, GCS)
- Cloud monitoring and alerting integration

## Tasks
- Implement AWS PowerShell module integration
- Create CloudFormation templates for AWS deployments
- Add AWS CDK support for infrastructure as code
- Implement Google Cloud PowerShell cmdlets
- Create Google Cloud Deployment Manager templates
- Add Terraform support for multi-cloud infrastructure
- Integrate cloud-native database services
- Implement cloud storage automation
- Add cloud monitoring and alerting setup
- Create cloud cost optimization strategies
- Implement cloud security best practices
- Add multi-cloud failover and disaster recovery

## Business Value
- Vendor independence and flexibility
- Cloud-native architecture benefits
- Global deployment capabilities
- Improved resilience and disaster recovery

## Dependencies
- Story 01 (Foundation with existing Azure support)
- Story 06 (Container orchestration supports cloud deployments)

## Estimated Effort
Large (2 weeks) - Multiple cloud platform integration

## Status
