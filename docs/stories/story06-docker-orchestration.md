# Story 06 - Docker Orchestration and Container Management

## Overview
Enhance Docker support with comprehensive container orchestration, Docker Compose configurations, and advanced containerized deployment scenarios.

## Goals
- Implement Docker Compose orchestration for multi-service deployments
- Add Kubernetes deployment support
- Enhance container networking and service discovery
- Provide container monitoring and health checks

## Acceptance Criteria
- Docker Compose configurations for development and production
- Kubernetes deployment manifests and Helm charts
- Container health checks and monitoring
- Advanced networking with service discovery
- Container registry integration
- Automated container image building and deployment

## Tasks
- Create Docker Compose files for multi-service scenarios
- Develop Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Create Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments
- Implement container health checks and readiness probes
- Add container monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
- Set up automated container image building
- Implement container registry integration (Docker Hub/ACR)
- Add container networking and service mesh support
- Create container security scanning
- Implement rolling updates and blue-green deployments
- Add container log aggregation and management
- Create documentation for container deployment patterns

## Business Value
- Modern containerized deployment capabilities
- Scalable and reliable cloud-native architecture
- Improved development to production parity
- Enhanced operational efficiency
