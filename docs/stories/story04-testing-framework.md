# Story 04 - Comprehensive Testing Framework

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive testing framework covering PowerShell scripts, Angular frontend, integration tests, and automated CI/CD validation.

## Goals
- Establish automated testing for PowerShell automation scripts
- Implement Angular unit and integration tests
- Create end-to-end testing for complete workflows
- Set up continuous integration pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria
- PowerShell unit tests using Pester framework
- Angular unit tests with good coverage (>80%)
- Integration tests for key automation workflows
- End-to-end tests for complete deployment scenarios
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- Test reporting and coverage metrics

## Tasks
- Set up Pester testing framework for PowerShell scripts
- Create unit tests for core PowerShell functions
- Implement mock frameworks for external dependencies
- Add Angular unit tests for components and services
- Create integration tests for database operations
- Develop end-to-end tests for complete plots
- Set up test data management and cleanup
- Configure GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps pipeline
- Implement automated test execution on PR/commit
- Add code coverage reporting
- Create testing documentation and guidelines
- Set up performance testing for large deployments

## Business Value
- Increased reliability and confidence in deployments
- Faster development cycles with automated validation
- Reduced manual testing effort
- Early detection of regressions

## Dependencies
- Story 03 (Standardized code makes testing easier)

## Estimated Effort
Large (1-2 weeks) - Comprehensive testing setup across multiple technologies

## Status
Planned
