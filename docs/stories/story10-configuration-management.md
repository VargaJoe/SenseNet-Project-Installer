# Story 10 - Configuration Management Enhancement

## Overview
Implement advanced configuration management with validation, templating, environment promotion, and configuration drift detection to improve reliability and maintainability.

## Goals
- Configuration validation and schema enforcement
- Configuration templating and inheritance
- Environment-specific configuration promotion
- Configuration drift detection and remediation

## Acceptance Criteria
- JSON schema validation for all configuration files
- Configuration templating system with variables and inheritance
- Environment promotion workflows (dev → staging → production)
- Configuration drift detection and alerting
- Configuration version control and rollback
- Encrypted configuration storage for sensitive data

## Tasks
- Create JSON schemas for configuration validation
- Implement configuration validation in startup process
- Design configuration templating system
- Add support for configuration variables and substitution
- Implement configuration inheritance hierarchies
- Create environment promotion workflows
- Add configuration diff and comparison tools
- Implement configuration drift detection
- Add configuration backup and rollback capabilities
- Encrypt sensitive configuration data
- Create configuration documentation generator
- Implement configuration testing and validation

## Business Value
- Reduced configuration errors and deployment failures
- Easier environment management and promotion
- Improved security for sensitive configuration data
- Better configuration governance and compliance

## Dependencies
- Story 01 (Foundation provides existing JSON configuration system)
- Story 05 (Security provides encryption capabilities)

## Estimated Effort
Medium (1 week) - Building on existing configuration foundation

## Status
Planned
