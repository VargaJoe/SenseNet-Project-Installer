# Implementation Tasks and Project Analysis

## Project Overview
The SenseNet Project Installer is a comprehensive PowerShell-based automation framework designed for managing SenseNet CMS installations and deployments. The project combines backend PowerShell scripts with an Angular frontend to provide both command-line and GUI-based management capabilities.

## Current Project State (Analysis completed: 2025-07-02)

### Branch Analysis
**Current Branch**: `develop` (significantly ahead of master)
**Key Differences**: The develop branch contains substantial improvements including Docker support, Azure deployments, .NET Core compatibility, and enhanced error handling.

### Architecture Analysis
- **Main Framework**: PowerShell script automation with modular design
- **Entry Point**: `src/Deployment/Scripts/Run.ps1`
- **Module System**: Auto-loading from `AutoExt` folder with new specialized modules
- **Configuration**: JSON-based settings system with environment-specific files and environment variable override
- **Frontend**: Angular 5-based GUI with REST API communication (unchanged between branches)

### Core Capabilities (Enhanced in Develop Branch)
- IIS site lifecycle management (create, start, stop)
- Database operations (backup, restore, create, drop) with SQL Server authentication
- SenseNet CMS deployment automation
- **NEW**: Docker containerization support for SenseNet applications
- **NEW**: Azure Web App deployment automation
- **NEW**: .NET Core project support alongside .NET Framework
- **NEW**: SSL certificate creation and management
- Visual Studio/TFS integration
- NuGet package management with Docker scenarios
- Content import/export
- Index population and management
- Host file management for development
- **NEW**: Network and port management for containerized deployments

### Current Issues Identified
1. **Documentation**: README mentions "under construction" and project "on hold" - needs comprehensive update
2. **Technology Stack**: Angular 5 is outdated (current is Angular 15+)
3. **License Inconsistency**: Main project uses GPL v2, GUI uses MIT
4. **Internationalization**: Some Hungarian text in documentation
5. **Project Status**: Marked as "on hold" due to SenseNet transitioning to cloud service
6. **Code Standards**: Mixed coding patterns and some legacy code structures

## Completed Tasks
